# E05b-Physics

For this project, I follwed the instructions on how to produce gravity effects within the Python arcade engine. Main1 introduces the concept with a simple gravity drop of objects within the file. Main2 introduces how gravity can be used to move the objects in certain ways, such as making them bounce when they hit the "ground".
